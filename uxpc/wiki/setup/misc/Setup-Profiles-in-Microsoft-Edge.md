Important to note here is that you'll have the choice of either choosing a "Microsoft account" or a "Work or school account".

<br>

**Microsoft account:** typically consists of a consumer account (hotmail, outlook...)

<br>

**Work or school account:** These are the accounts you've created in the setup phase of creating a new trial account (which uses "onmicrosoft.com" or other work e-mail addresses through Microsoft.

# Selecting your active profile

Underneath you'll see the different active accounts you can currently select:

![2020-08-25 12_59_48-.png](/.attachments/2020-08-25%2012_59_48--349aa330-0c7e-460b-81a5-0e5558a9089a.png)

In the above example you see that the current active account is the Trial Account, underneath you can see the Work account. To switch between accounts, you just have to select the account you want to be using. A new window will then pop up with your currently selected active account. Now you have 2 windows open, each with a different active account.

#Altering your Active profile

The profile you've created under "Setting up a new profile in Microsoft Edge" usually has a default name such as "Profile 2, Profile 3...". To make it more comprehensive this can be changed by clicking on **Manage profile settings**:

Here you can edit the name of your profile by **clicking** on the **three points next to the sign in button**.
