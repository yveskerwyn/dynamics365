# Setup Dynamics 365 Sales Trial

The below documented steps are best used after having created a Microsoft 365 trial, as documented in [Start with a Microsoft 365 E5 Trial](/setup/Start-with-a-Microsoft-365-E5-Trial).

As a result of following the below steps you will only get a **Dynamics 365 Sales** trial instance. In many cases you will also want **Customer Service** and **Field Service**. If that is the case for you, rather follow the steps as documented in [Add the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Trial](/setup/Add-the-Dynamics-365-Customer-Engagement-Plan-Trial).

Alternatively you can also created a Sales trial without first creating a Microsoft 365 trial, as documented in [Initial Setup](/setup/Initial-Setup).

Go to Dynamics 365 Trial home page and select the **Sales** tile:

In stead of ending up with the previous screen after installation, you also might end-up here:

From there you can click to the **Sales Hub** app, or any other of the applications such as the **Customer Service Hub** or **Field Service** apps.

You can also check the **Power Platform admin center** via https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/:

Or clicking **Dynamics 365 app** in the **Resources** section reveils all the apps that got installed as part of this trial:
