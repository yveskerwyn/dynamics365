## Environments

Go to **Power Platform admin center**:
https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments

![marketing-trial-new-environment](images/marketing-trial-new-environment.png)

Notice that a new environment has been created as a result of installing a trial of the Marketing app.

Click the newly added environment:

![marketing-trial-open-new-environment](images/marketing-trial-open-new-environment.png)

Click **Edit**:

![marketing-trial-edit-new-environment](images/marketing-trial-edit-new-environment.png)

Update both the name and URL:

![marketing-trial-update-new-environment](images/marketing-trial-update-new-environment.png)

This will actually change nothing, but rather will help avoid confusing when adding other applications to the environments.

Optionally you can add the marketing app to the environment where the sales app was created. In order to do so go to the overview page of all Dynamics 365 apps that are installed in this environment:

![marketing-trial-all-installed-dynamics-apps](images/marketing-trial-all-installed-dynamics-apps.png)  

Click **Install app**, choose the **Dynamics 365 Marketing Application** from the list and click **Next**:

![marketing-trial-install-marketing-app](images/marketing-trial-install-marketing-app.png)

Click **OK**:
